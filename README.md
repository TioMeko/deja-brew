# Deja Brew

## Description

We created an application that enables individuals to search for breweries in a specific town or city. This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It uses Tailwind and pulls information from two APIs. It has a clean and polished responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
